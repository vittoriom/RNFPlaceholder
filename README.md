RNFPlaceholder
==============

A placeholder project for the work in progress framework RuntimeNetworkFoundation.

A CocoaPods setup will be done when the MVP will be ready.

Even then, please only use the CocoaPods setup, because in the near future the project will be split in multiple subprojects (and sub-pods), since its components are engineered to be usable individually.
